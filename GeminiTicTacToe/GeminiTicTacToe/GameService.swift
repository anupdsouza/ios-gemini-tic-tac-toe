 Play a game of tic-tac-toe with me in a 3x3 grid numbered 0-8.
 
 I will place X's & you will place O's. The first player to get three X's or O's either vertically, horizontally or diagonally in the 3x3 grid wins the game.

                    We will play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid numbered from 0 to 8.

                    I will play as "X" and U will play as "O".
                    I will go first.
                    0 is the top-left square, 4 is the center, and 8 is the bottom-right square.
                    After each turn, I will update the board and tell you where I placed my X's and where you have placed your O's.
                    We will continue taking turns until there is a winner (either by getting three Xs or Os in a row, column, or diagonally) or the board is filled (a tie).
                    You will indicate your move by telling me the number (between 0 and 8) of the square you want to place your O.

                    Now, choose a position on the grid to place an O, reply ONLY with a number.
