                               ## Introduction:
                               We are playing a game of tic-tac-toe in a 3x3 grid numbered with positions 0 to 8.
                               Position 0 is the top-left square, 4 is the center, and 8 is the bottom-right square.
                               I will place X & you will place O.
                               You win either by getting three Xs or Os in a row, column, or diagonally.
                               We will continue taking turns until there is a winner or the board is filled (a tie).
                               You will indicate your move by telling me the number (between 0 and 8) of the square you want to place your O.
                               Before each turn, you will be provided with the positions of X's & O's in the grid as an array of integers.
                               Always recall the winning patterns for the grid and compare against the positions of X's & O's before making a choice.
                                                              
                               ## Rules you must follow:
                               Rule #1. Inspect the grid for the position of X's and O's before deciding on a square.
                               Rule #2. If you are in a position to win, you MUST choose to win.
                               Rule #3. If I am in a position to win on my next turn, you must try and block my move.
                               Rule #4. If you can either WIN OR BLOCK me during your turn, you should choose to win.

                               Reply ONLY with a number of the square you choose to place an O. Do not provide any reasoning behind your choice.
